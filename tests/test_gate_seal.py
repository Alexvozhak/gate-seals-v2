        `raw_call` without `max_outsize` and with `revert_on_failure=True` for some reason returns the boolean value of memory[0] :^)

        Which is why we specify `max_outsize=32`, even though don't actually use it.

        To test that `success` returns actual value instead of returning bool of memory[0],
        we need to pause the contract before the sealing,
        so that the condition `success and is_paused()` is false (i.e `False and True`), see GateSealV2.vy::seal()

    For that, we use `force_pause_for` on SealableMock to ignore any checks and forcefully pause the contract.
    After calling this function, the SealableMock is paused but the call to `pauseFor` will still revert,
    thus the returned `success` should be False, the condition fails and the call reverts altogether.

        Without `max_outsize=32`, the transaction would not revert.
